	<p class="text1">Good day citizens. I am the worst Colorado native you'll probably ever meet. <br>I only drink beer on occasion and I rarely ski. I grew up in Westminster, CO <br>and I spent most of my time avoiding responsibility and adulthood. <br>In this measure, I have failed. In general, I spend my time reading science <br>fiction, working out, playing with my dog, and bragging about stuff. <br> I have a family but they all moved away :(
